## About CredibleSource.org

You may notice that pretty much everything on the main page is a lie. This is intentional.

Q. But how can you have a .org if you aren't legitimate?  
A. Because literally anyone can register a .org domain.

This site is built largely as a wakeup call to teachers around America (and likely in other countries) that the TLD (the thing the website ends in, `.com`, `.net`, `.org`, etc) doesn't give any proof of it's legitimacy.
